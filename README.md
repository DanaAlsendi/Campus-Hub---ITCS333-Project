This is the project of ITCS333 course. I took this course in year 3 specially the 2nd course with Dr. Abdulla Ebrahim Subah. I like the course but in my opinion the teaching method was not perfect! In this course i learned about HTML (Hyper text Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), JavaScript, and PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor). In this repository I will find the project codes for all the modules.

I was responsible for campus news module.
